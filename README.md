# WeRateDogs_Wrangle_and_Analyze
## Introduction
Real-world data rarely comes clean. Using Python and its libraries, you are able to gather data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it.
The dataset in this project which will be wrangled (and analyzed and visualized) is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because "they're good dogs Brent." WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.
